## 1. Project description:
The Iris dataset contains data on four features: length and width of sepals and petals for 50 data samples belonging to three different species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. The aim of this report was to use PCA to analyse relationships between the four features mentioned above and three principal components identified by PCA.

## 2. The project contains the following analyses: 
* **Data pre-processing** 
* **Analysing correlations between numerical features**
* **Performing PCA to identify three principal components**
* **Visualising correlations between PCs and the numerical features**
